            <br>
            <p class="case_study_body">Brief: For this project, my goal was to organize booking information into one, central location so that it is easily accessible. I also sought to make booking cards more descriptive and efficient. This way, users don’t have to go through the same pathways to access individual bits of information.<br>
            <br>User: a busy & ambitious pet sitter that wants to stay organized<br>
            
            <br>Strategy: maintain Rover’s brand and increase effeciency of existing app components<br></p>
            <img class="case_study_img" src="/Images/Rover/Home.png">
            <h1 class="case_study_title">Introduction</h1><br>
            <p class="case_study_body">I’ve been using Rover as a dog sitter for over four months now and have boarded 11 different dogs. The app is “the nation’s largest pet sitting and walking network.” Through Rover, pet owners can book available sitters in their area.<br>
            
            <br>The first thing I did was create a profile. Your sitter profile contains a detailed account of your experience, your day-to-day schedule, what you would like to know about prospective clients, your pricing and last, but not least, reviews. Together, this information acts as both your resume and your selling card. I find to be an effective, competitive system for both pet owners and sitters. Pet owners want to book the best available, and pet sitters can adjust their pricing based on demand.<br>
                        
            <br>While using the app, I noticed several repetitive functions and several that could be introduced to create a more streamlined experience for boarders. 
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h1 class="case_study_title">The booking process</h1>
            <br><p class="case_study_body">The first step to understanding user activity is to understand the booking process.</p>
            <img class="case_study_img" src="/Images/Rover/The Booking Process.png">
            <h1 class="case_study_title">Booking cards</h1>
            <img class="case_study_img booking_card" src="/Images/Rover/booking_card.png">
            <p class="booking_card_body">A booking card is where a sitter goes for all relevant information for pending, ongoing, upcoming and past bookings. It displays a profile picture of the client, the client’s name, the time of last correspondance, the client’s boarding dates, a preview of the last message and the booking status. 
                <br>
                <br>
                When you click on a booking card, it leads to even further information about the booking: the message between sitter and client, payment details, exact drop-off and pick-up dates and times and the client’s care info.<br>
                <br>The key change in this new iteration is adding a status tag to all bookings. Rover already uses a form of status tags but only for pending bookings. I introduced three new status tags: Upcoming, Happening Now and Archived. This new organizational system eliminates the need to separate pending and upcoming bookings into two separate pages–as it is set up now–and sitters can view all current bookings in one, fluid page.</p>
            <img class="case_study_img booking_status_card" src="/Images/Rover/Booking Tags.png">
            <p class="booking_card_body">I did, however, keep a separation between current and past bookings via a button. The button allows users to toggle between the two lists.</p>
            <img class="case_study_img past_current_bookings" src="/Images/Rover/current_past_bookings.png">
            <p class="booking_card_body">Now that all past bookings are in one place, and maintaining the philosophy that all booking cards lead to the same place, I can eliminate the “Rebook” tab and nest “Notifications” in its place.</p>
            <h1 class="case_study_title"><br>Notifications</h1>
            <img class="case_study_img" src="/Images/Rover/Notifications.png">
            <p class="booking_card_body"><br>I've been using Rover for over 4 months now, and I have yet to receive a notification. It’s unclear why new messages, new boarding requests, booking confirmations, booking modifications and etc don’t appear in the notifications page. It’s high time they do!<br>
            
                <br>A “Notifications” page creates a hub where information is organized by the time it comes in, in contrast to booking cards, which are organized by a variety of booking information.<br>
                        
                <br>This way, sitters can look through their notifications and ensure they haven’t missed any activity and they have a reminder to respond to any outstanding messages.</p>

                <img class="case_study_img" src="/Images/Rover/Calendar (Weekly).png">
                <h1 class="case_study_title"><br>In conclusion</h1>
                <br><p class="booking_card_body">Above all, this was a highly informative exercise. Challenging myself with a product re-design meant that I first had to study the intention of the base design. Understanding why each component exists, why it was placed where it is, what app functionality looks like and so on and so forth, drove the re-design. The base design dictated what adjustments were feasible. I am now a more educated and dedicated user!</p>
