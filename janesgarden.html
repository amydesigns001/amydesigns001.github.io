                <h3 class="brief_title">Intro</h3>
                <p class="brief_body">Jane, a local business owner of a plant shop that I frequent, came to me with an app idea. She has quite a few regular customers that visit her shop to grow (pun very much intended) their indoor plant collection.<br><br>Jane noticed that many of her customers returned to her shop after making a purchase to ask her questions about caring for their new plant. Many of her customers are first-time owners with little to no experience caring for a plant, and they are nervous and have a lot of questions!<br><br>                
                    Jane’s innovative idea for an app would, of course, incorporate her storefront and be a place where people can purchase plants. It would also serve as a resource for new and old plant owners alike to reference care guides for the plants they own. This way, customers would feel more confident in their purchases, and it would encourage more purchases.

            <div class="brief_container">
                <h3 class="brief_title">The User</h3>
                <p class="brief_body">Without having the budget to conduct any of my own research for this project, I had to creatively source information about projected users. To start, I went to the source: Jane. As the owner of a succulent shop for more than 10 years, Jane shared a lot of valuable insights about the type of consumers she encountered.<br>
                    <br>Although the in-person consumers Jane interacted with at her store would not be an exact projection of user of the app, it was a good place to start. Additionally, Jane’s physical customers would be the first group that this app would be marketed towards.<br>
                    <br>Jane’s customers were anywhere from 18-40. She noticed that they are usually single adults, or adults that live by themselves. They are individuals that have more time to spend caring and learning about plants.</p>

                <h3 class="brief_title">Problem Statement</h3>
                <p class="brief_body">Ricky is a marketing strategist in NYC that works from home. While he isn’t quite ready to commit to getting a cat or a dog, he thinks a succulent will be a great starting point. He walks by a plant store every week, on his way to the grocery store, but hasn’t walked in yet, because he doesn’t know the first thing about plants.

                <p class="brief_body">This app will benefit from a wide usability study, in order to gauge a broader range of users. It would be interesting to see how frequently users will return to the app after initially reading care guides.</p>

                <h3 class="brief_title">Next Steps</h3>
                <p class="brief_body">Add more plant selections and accompanying care guides. Allow users to create their own accounts for ease of access to their bookmarked plants.</p>
